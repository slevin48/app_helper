## Data
To test and develop app, I wrote another function that creates some perfectly imperfect data to the tune of 500,000 rows and 58 MB on disk as a CSV file ([available here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinhchae/app_helper/main/data/source.csv)). I like the 58 MB size because I think itâ€™s right at the threshold of being too much to handle both on disk and in memory.
